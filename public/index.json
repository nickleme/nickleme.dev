When I\u0026rsquo;m not doing that, I\u0026rsquo;m probably looking for something in other mediums that can add to the gaming space—or climbing, maybe a little bit of both.\nThis site is where I can discuss all of this. Both from a technological and human perspective. I\u0026rsquo;m attempting to share what I\u0026rsquo;ve learned, trying to warn others about possible pitfalls, and figuring out ways I can keep improving in this everlasting climb towards fun.\nCareer #\rOver the past 8 years, I\u0026rsquo;ve been gathering experience in the indie game space, successfully launching games on Steam, Switch and Google Play Store. I intimately understand the indie development cycle and have extensive experience working on games from the first prototype to completion within small remote teams and tight deadlines.\nIn roles ranging from Creative Director to Engineering Team Lead, I\u0026rsquo;ve honed my expertise in gameplay programming. Whether crafting weapons, designing enemies, or optimizing inventory systems, gameplay remains my focus. I just love developing systems that transport the player to a new reality.\nI thrive in collaborative environments, as I\u0026rsquo;m used to closely partnering with design and art teams to develop tools that enhance engine capabilities and streamline debugging processes.\nInfo #\rCo-founder of Studio Bravarda, where I directed Extremely Powerful Capybaras and developed Sky Caravan with friends and shipped them to multiple platforms.
