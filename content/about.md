## About me

Hey there!

I'm Nick, and I'm here to try and find my place on the internet. 

Having experienced the indie development struggles, the birth and collapse of startups (not [Studio Bravarda](studiobravarda.com) we're okay!), and the hardships of the gaming industry, I believe I have something to add to the table, and I've already spent a lot of time behind the curtains.

I adore games, talking about them, discussing them, and of course making them. When I'm not doing that, I'm probably looking for something in other mediums that can add to the gaming spaceâ€”or climbing, maybe a little bit of both. 

This site is where I can discuss all of this. Both from a technological and human perspective. I'm attempting to share what I've learned, trying to warn others about possible pitfalls, and figuring out ways I can keep improving in this everlasting climb towards fun.

## Career

Over the past 8 years, I've been gathering experience in the indie game space, successfully launching games on Steam, Switch and Google Play Store. I intimately understand the indie development cycle and have extensive experience working on games from the first prototype to completion within small remote teams and tight deadlines.

In roles ranging from Creative Director to Engineering Team Lead, I've honed my expertise in gameplay programming. Whether crafting weapons, designing enemies, or optimizing inventory systems, gameplay remains my focus. I just love developing systems that transport the player to a new reality.

I thrive in collaborative environments, as I'm used to closely partnering with design and art teams to develop tools that enhance engine capabilities and streamline debugging processes.
