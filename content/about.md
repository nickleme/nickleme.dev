## About me

Hey there!

I'm Nick a Senior Gameplay Programmer that shipped games with [Studio Bravarda](studiobravarda.com) and [Ocarina Studios](https://www.ocarinastudios.com/). Now just an associate at Bravarda, I'm looking for new opportunities in the gaming industry.

Having experienced the indie development struggles, the birth and collapse of startups, and the hardships of the gaming industry, I have a lot to add to any project. 

I'm experienced working on games from the first prototype to completion within small remote teams and tight deadlines.

Over the past 8 years, I've been using Unity to successfully launch games on Steam, Switch and Google Play Store.

I love working on every aspect of the gameplay experience, whether crafting weapons, designing enemies, or optimizing inventory systems.

Collaborative environments are my safe space, as I'm used to closely partnering with design and art teams to develop tools that enhance engine capabilities and streamline debugging processes.
